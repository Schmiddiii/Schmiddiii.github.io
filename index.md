# WhoAmI

Hi, I am `Schmiddi`.
If you know the domain of this website, you probably already know my real name, so I won't mention it.

I am currently studying computer science at the university in Passau.

# What I am working on.

I currently have the following projects:

- [Tubefeeder](https://schmiddiii.github.io/Tubefeeder/): A Youtube-Client made for the Pinephone.
- [qute-cookie-block](https://github.com/Schmiddiii/qute-cookie-block): Blocking cookies for [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/).

Note that these repositories may not have had commits for a few weeks or months as I do not work on these during university.
